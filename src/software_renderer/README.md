# engine

A Software rendering engine written in C++. Started with the intent of comparing modern graphics hardware performance with a 
software renderer on a modern CPU. 

It's written using Data Oriented programming, as apposed to Object Oriented programming, to make it (hopefully) easier to
optimize in the future.
